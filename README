Wildflower 1.3 Beta - A CakePHP CMS
***********************************

Requirements
============

    * Apache web server with mod_rewrite
    * No problem to run under some other web server like lighttpd or IIS, you just need to emulate the mod_rewrite rules 
    * PHP 5.2 or higher (reported to work with 5.1)
    * MySQL 4.1 or higher

Installation
============

   1. Extract the archive. Place the 'wildflower' directory inside your apache document root or some folder under it. Of course you can rename the 'wildflower' directory at will.
   2. Create a new MySQL database. Use 'utf8_unicode_ci' collation. Into this new database import the SQL dump file 'app/config/sql/wildflower.sql'.
   3. Edit the app/config/database.php file with your database connection details.
   4. You've got a working copy of http://wf.klevo.sk site. You can start working on your project by modifying the application inside the app directory. When a new release of Wildflower comes, you simply update the cake, vendors and wildflower directories.
   5. The admin area is located under 'http://your-site/wf'. This can be changed by changing the 'Wildflower.prefix' configure key in 'app/plugins/wildflower/config/core.php'.
   6. Default login/password combination for admin area is admin/admin321 --Don`t forget to change this when in production.
   
Wildflower is not and won't be a CakePHP plugin
===============================================

WF uses the additional MVC paths CakePHP feature. All the Wildflower MVC (model, view, controller) files are located inside the /wildflower directory. Except the app_controller.php, app_model.php and app_helper.php. These are of course essential for proper WF functioning and are found standardly at the /app folder. This architecture enables you to copy any WF MVC file into your /app folder, modify it and Cake will automatically use it. Of course it's recommented to create your own controllers/models/etc. for your custom functionality, but this feature is here if you need to modify some core Wildflower functionality or do a quick hack AND upgrading won't be a nightmare.
    
Upgrading
=========

    1. Copy and overwrite all the files with the new version.
    2. Run database migrations. From your working folder launch from the shell: 'php vendors/ruckusing/main.php db:migrate'. This will update your database to the latest version.
   
Problems logging in after updating to AuthComponent enabled version? (1.3b1) / need to generate a password to insert directly into DB?
======================================================================================================================================

Use the UtilityShell to generate an AuthComponent compatible password hash:
./cake/console/cake wildflower hash myPassword

Insert the result into your database in the 'password' field of the 'wild_users' table.
