== Intro ==

This package contains a basic framework for creating and running PHP DB migrations. The idea is borrowed from Ruby on Rails migrations, which allow one to use a series of named files to express the state of the DB at any one time.

== Requirements ==
This package has some requirements which must be met:

1) PHP5 or above. 

2) PEAR MDB2: used as our DB abstraction layer. You will also need the associated DB driver
for each kind of database you have, e.g. for MySQL you will need the MDB2/mysql driver.
